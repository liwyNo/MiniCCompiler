This is an example of the simplest possible autograded lab, called "hello." It uses 
the recommended file format that we've found helpful in the past. 

To build the lab:
linux> make clean
linux> make 

To test offline:
linux> cd test-autograder
linux> make clean
linux> make

# Basic files created by the lab author
Makefile                Builds the lab from src/
README                  
autograde-Makefile      Makefile that runs the autograder 
src/                    Contains all src files and solutions         
test-autograder/        For testing autograder offline
writeup/                Lab writeup that students view from Autolab    

# Files created by running make
hello-handout/          The directory that is handed out to students, created
                        using files from src/. 
hello-handout.tar       Archive of hello-handout directory
autograde.tar           File that is copied to the autograding instance 
                        (along with autograde-Makefile and student handin file)

# Files created and managed by Autolab
handin/    All students handin files
hello.rb   Config file
hello.yml  Database properties that persist from semester to semester
log.txt    Log of autograded submissions
